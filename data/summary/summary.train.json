This surgery involves taking an\n      artery from the scalp outside the skull, making a small hole in the skull and then connecting\n      the scalp artery to a brain artery inside the skull. In this way the blockage of the carotid\n      artery in the neck is bypassed and more blood can flow to the brain. In some people natural\n      bypass arteries develop and the brain is already getting plenty of blood. These people have a\n      low risk of stroke if they take medicine. In other people, no natural bypass arteries develop\n      so less blood flows to their brains. This second group has a much higher risk of stroke while\n      taking medicine, as high as 25-50% within the next two years. It is this second group of\n      people who may benefit from having the bypass operation and who are the candidates for this\n      study.\n\n      This bypass surgery is considered experimental because it is not generally performed for this\n      condition and it is unknown whether it leads to a decrease, an increase or no change in the\n      risk of stroke. In order to determine if people fit into this second group of people who may\n      benefit from the bypass operation they need to have a test called a PET scan. The PET scan\n      measures the amount of blood that is getting to the brain and the amount of oxygen that the\n      brain is using. The PET scan uses radioactive oxygen and water and is experimental (not\n      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration). If the PET scan shows that less\n      blood is getting to the brain, there will be a 50-50 chance (like a coin toss) of receiving\n      the bypass surgery or not. There will then be follow-up visits to the clinic one month later\n      and then every three months for two years to check on the appropriate medical treatment that\n      everyone will receive and to determine who has had a stroke.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery when added to best\n      medical therapy can reduce by 40 percent  subsequent stroke within  two years in participants\n      with recent TIA ('ministroke\") or stroke (</= 120 days) due to blockage of the carotid artery\n      and reduced blood flow to the brain measured by PET.\n    "}, {"p": "http://data.linkedct.org/resource/linkedct/summary", "s": "http://data.linkedct.org/resource/trials/NCT00029146", "o": "\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery when\n      added to best medical therapy can reduce the subsequent risk of ipsilateral stroke in\n      high-risk patients with recently symptomatic carotid occlusion and increased cerebral oxygen\n      extraction fraction measured by PET.\n    "}], "ideal_answer": "The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, when added to the best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and an elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the occlusion.", "concepts": ["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2014/MB_cgi?field=uid&exact=Find+Exact+Term&term=D016430", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2014/MB_cgi?field=uid&exact=Find+Exact+Term&term=D002986"], "type": "summary", "id": "5314c045dae131f847000007", "snippets": [{"offsetInBeginSection": 8, "offsetInEndSection": 399, "text": "The Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) was conducted to determine if superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, when added to the best medical therapy, would reduce subsequent ipsilateral stroke in patients with complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and an elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the occlusion.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23101451", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 0, "offsetInEndSection": 150, "text": "Extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery for stroke prevention in hemodynamic cerebral ischemia: the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study randomized trial.", "beginSection": "title", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22068990", "endSection": "title"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 201, "offsetInEndSection": 436, "text": "To test the hypothesis that extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery, added to best medical therapy, reduces subsequent ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with recently symptomatic AICAO and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia.

By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells.

This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells.

Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a \"younger\" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype.

In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGF\u03b21 under exogenous TGF\u03b21 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

CMTs are characterized by the presence of a chromatin-associated domain (chromodomain) inserted within the catalytic protein motifs I and IV. CMTs have likely evolved because of  the high levels of CpNpG methylation present in plant genomes relative to animal genomes. The targeting of CMT methylation is accomplished by short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways and histone methylation (H3K9, H3K27). It has been shown that transposons are in vivo targets of CMT-dependent methylation, suggesting that CMTs play a role in the plant genome surveillance. In Arabidopsis, CMTs play a key role in egg cell reprogramming and normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote by mediating transposon and euchromatin epigenetic gene silencing.

Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy.

At present, de novo cardiomyocytes can be generated either in vitro, using directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, or in vivo via direct reprogramming of resident adult cardiac fibroblast or ectopic stimulation of resident cardiac stem or progenitor cells. The production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study \"disease in a dish\" within a defined genetic and environmental background. Patient-derived iPSCs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. Long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future.
