The modern B1 elements are similar to the left Alu monomer but with a 9 bp deletion and a 29 bp duplication.	The mouse B1 sequence is congruent to 130 nucleotides long and shows homology with the monomeric units of the dimeric 300-nucleotide primate sequence.we present evidence that Alu and B1 elements have been selectively retained in the upstream and intronic regions of genes belonging to specific functional classes.Alus and B1s are short interspersed repeat elements (SINEs) derived from the 7SL RNA gene.The data demonstrate that a limited set of B1 sequences are expressed as processed RNA polymerase III-transcripts of a high degree of structural conservation. The core sequences of these elements contain pol III promoters but must rely on fortuitous downstream oligo(dT) tracts for terminator function.Alus and B1s exist in the cytoplasm as non-coding RNA indicating that they are actively transcribed but their function if any is unknown.Furthermore the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats i.e. from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.Here we show that some members of the mouse B1 Alu sequence family encode a small cytoplasmic RNA	Finally the unexpected finding that Alu and B1 elements show similar biases in their distribution across functional classes despite having spread independently in their respective genomes further supports our claim that the extant instances of Alu and B1 elements are the result of positive selection.Alu and B1 repeats are mobile elements that originated in an initial duplication of the 7SL RNA gene prior to the primate-rodent split about 80 million years ago and currently account for a substantial fraction of the human and mouse genome respectivelyAlus and B1s exist in the cytoplasm as non-coding RNA indicating that they are actively transcribed but their function if any is unknown.Furthermore the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats i.e. from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.Here we show that some members of the mouse B1 Alu sequence family encode a small cytoplasmic RNAB1 (Alu-equivalent) is a murine short interspersed element whose amplification probably involved an RNA intermediateMost human Alu and murine B1 repeats are unique.	0.06818181818181818	0.38636363636363635	Progression

Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) is a mechanism of gene inactivation that affects multiple contiguous CpG islands and has been described in different human cancer types.We were able to gain a comprehensive view of promoters with various CpG densities including CpG Islands (CGIs) transcript bodies and various repeat classes.We now investigate whether LRES also occurs in prostate cancer across this 4-Mb region and whether differential DNA methylation of 2q14.2 genes could provide a regional panel of prostate cancer biomarkers.We propose that consolidation or effective reduction of the cancer genome commonly occurs in domains through a combination of LRES and LOH or genomic deletion resulting in reduced transcriptional plasticity within these regions.Our results not only provide the first evidence that LRES can have functional specific effects in cancer but also identify several deregulated Ikaros targets that may contribute to progression in colorectal adenocarcinoma.By creating an integrated prostate cancer epigenome map using tiling arrays we show that contiguous regions of gene suppression commonly occur through long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES).

Clinical trials have shown that Tumor-treating fields are effective for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in solid tumor brain metastases and ovarian pancreatic cancers and multidrug resistance cancer cells.	Alternating electric fields (tumor-treating fields therapy) can improve chemotherapy treatment efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo.A third patient on NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small slow growing enhancing lesion which was resected and his fields were adjusted accordingly.Six months later two new distal lesions were noted and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields.Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma solid tumor brain metastases nonsmall cell lung cancer and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.Together these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival.Mitotic disruption and reduced clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by tumor treating fields.	 A second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ.Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration 12.9 months).One mesothelioma patient experienced lesion regression near TTFields with simultaneous tumor stability or progression in distal areas.CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients in this study is small the lack of therapy toxicity and the efficacy observed in data gathered to date indicate the potential of TTFields as a new treatment modality for solid tumors definitely warranting further investigation.These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell count an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity.The first patient underwent subtotal resection radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ.Alternating electric fields (TTFields) inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs.	0.39473684210526316	0.05263157894736842	Regression

Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways and several inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease and asthma are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. Together Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. Mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue	Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammationNOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and InflammationSystematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation.Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells.This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammationIn contrast Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction.The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB).In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.	Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice.These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model.NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in miceThe nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB) a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery.Together Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation.The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycanIn contrast to enhanced leptin mRNA by LPS and TNFα NOD1 activation suppressed leptin mRNA in adipocytes suggesting the differential effects of NOD1 activation in adipocytes.Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model	0.0660377358490566	0.18867924528301888	Hard

"The genome projects have unearthed an enormous diversity of genes of unknown function that are still awaiting biological and biochemical characterization. These genes as most others can be grouped into families based on sequence similarity. The PFAM database currently contains over 2200 such families referred to as domains of unknown function (DUF). 
Critically examining domain covariation across metagenomic datasets can grant new perspectives on the roles and associations of DUFs in an ecological setting. Targeted attempts at DUF characterization in the laboratory or in silico may draw from these insights and opportunities to discover new associations and corroborate existing ones will arise as more large-scale metagenomic datasets emerge. 
In a coordinated effort the four large-scale centers of the NIH Protein Structure Initiative have determined the first three-dimensional structures for more than 250 of these DUF families."	 These families include proteins with domain of unknown function (DUF) DUF23 DUF246 and DUF266.The evidence for these proteins being GTs and their possible roles in cell wall biosynthesis is discussed.We have conducted NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies of four DUF1471 domains from Salmonella representing three different paralogous DUF1471 subfamilies: SrfN YahO and SssB/YdgH (two of its three DUF1471 domains: the N-terminal domain I (residues 21-91) and the C-terminal domain III (residues 244-314)).Here we report the characterization of 121 DUF1618 genes identified in the rice genome.The genome projects have unearthed an enormous diversity of genes of unknown function that are still awaiting biological and biochemical characterization.Bacterial species in the Enterobacteriaceae typically contain multiple paralogues of a small domain of unknown function (DUF1471) from a family of conserved proteins also known as YhcN or BhsA/McbA.For example DUF1618 family members in plants possess a 56-199-amino acid conserved domain and this family has not been described previously.

57092332cf1c325851000018	factoid	non-summary	What is the molecular function of the Chd1 protein?	The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzyme Chd1 is a 168-kDa protein consisting of a double chromodomain Snf2-related ATPase domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. One of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity. Human CHD1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4.	The DNA-binding domain of the Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzyme contains SANT and SLIDE domainsCHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene.Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor containing two tandem chromodomains.Thus the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome.Human but not yeast CHD1 binds directly and selectively to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 via its tandem chromodomainsThus while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome it can function to alter the levels of HP1a perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9.Through inclusion of Chd1 sequences in homology searches SLIDE domains were identified in CHD6-9 proteins.We find that the yeast Isw1a Isw2 and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not.	The ISWI and CHD1 chromatin remodelling activities influence ADH2 expression and chromatin organizationWe find that the yeast Isw1a Isw2 and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not.Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein. Chromodomain from heterochromatin protein 1 and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine-methylated histone H3 tail-binding module.Here we show that the absence of the Isw1 and Chd1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activities delays the maximal expression of ADH2 without impairing the chromatin remodelling that occurs upon activation.Thus while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome it can function to alter the levels of HP1a perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9.Thus the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome.	0.2153846153846154	0.07692307692307693	Hard

EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer. EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells. EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells. Composite index of c-Myc EZH2 and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.

Collectively our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3.The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells.he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells.Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e. a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer.However the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknownComposite index of c-Myc EZH2 and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.	0.07692307692307693	0.3974358974358974	Progression

Our findings suggest that the association of alpha-NAGA with its substrates is strongly affected by the amino acid substitution at R329 and that the association with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr is more highly susceptible to structural changes.These data suggest that a prototype of alpha-NAGA deficiency in Kanzaki disease and factors other than the defect of alpha-NAGA may contribute to severe neurological disorders and Kanzaki disease is thought to be caused by a single enzyme deficiency.Therefore the urinary ratio of GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser:GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr was lower and the clinical phenotype was milder in the R329Q mutation.We describe the neurologic findings in a patient with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency (Kanzaki disease).Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA) deficiency (Schindler/Kanzaki disease) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous genetic disease with a wide spectrum including an early onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (Schindler disease) and late onset angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (Kanzaki disease).

The association between hormone replacement therapy and meningioma risk is controversial. Increased risk of meningioma was demonstrated in estrogen-only hormonal replacement therapy. However other studies did not find an association between hormonal replacement therapy and meningioma risk.	The meta-analyses yielded significantly increased risks for all CNS tumors glioma and meningioma in users of estrogen-only [1.35 (1.22-1.49) 1.23 (1.06-1.42) and 1.31 (1.20-1.43) respectively] but not estrogen-progestin HT [1.09 (0.99-1.19) 0.92 (0.78-1.08) and 1.05 (0.95-1.16) respectively]; these differences were statistically significant (p<0.005 for each tumor type).The totality of the available evidence suggests an increased risk of all CNS tumors (and of glioma and meningioma separately) in users of estrogen-only HT.OC use was associated with increased risk of a meningioma expressing less rather than more PR (OR = 3.2 95% CI 1.3 - 8.0).BACKGROUND: The role of exogenous hormone exposures in the development of meningioma is unclear but these exposures have been proposed as one hypothesis to explain the over-abundance of such tumors in women.There was no association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk.Estradiol-only therapy was accompanied with a slightly increased risk of meningioma.	The relationship between current use of exogenous hormones and meningioma remains unclear limited by the small numbers of patients currently on oral hormone medications and a lack of hormone receptor data for meningioma tumors.Estradiol-only therapy was accompanied with a slightly increased risk of meningioma.There was no association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk.The use of hormone replacement therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women either with previously treated disease or with dormant tumors is discussed but remains controversial.RESULTS: Although risk of meningioma appeared modestly elevated in past OC users (OR = 1.5 95% CI 0.8 - 2.7) and in current users (OR = 2.5 95% CI 0.5 - 12.6) the confidence intervals were wide.In further analysis by hormone receptor status there was some indication for an increased risk of progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas associated with oral contraceptive use (OR 1.39 95% confidence interval 0.92-2.10) and other hormonal contraception (OR 1.50 95% CI 0.95-2.36).	0.1724137931034483	0.2413793103448276	Hard

Low 2D:4D ratio correlates with better performance and with enhanced sporting prowess particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and dependent upon slow-twitch muscles.	RESULTS: A highly significant difference was found in 2D:4D ratios of both the hands with Kabaddi players having a lower ratio compared to their controls.This research provides a stronger level of evidence that the 2D:4D ratio may help indicate potential athleticism or competition-level achievement but the external validity may be limited to only specific sports.We conclude that low right 2D:4D and low right - left 2D:4D difference are predictors of high rugby performance.Athletes active in the most aggressive form (the sabre) had lower 2D:4D than those active in the other forms (épée and foil fencing).Therefore we can speculate that low 2D:4D ratio may be a positive correlate of sports potential in females.There was no statistically significant difference in 2D:4D (Δ r-l) between Kabaddi players and controls.We found that right 2D:4D (but not left 2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches' ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30).

The method involves the generation of thiols by controlled reduction of cystine disulfide bonds in keratins the energy involved in the formation of disulfide bonds is much greater than that of hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions the structural transition is likely to be dominated by the requirement that the bonded cysteine residues occur at closely equivalent axial positions.e solubility test in the dithiothreitol/urea extraction buffer the amino acid composition analysis and studies on keratin secondary structures suggest that the improved stability in water of thermally treated mats can be ascribed to the formation of amide bonds between acid and basic groups of some amino acid side chains.

56c1f01eef6e394741000046	yesno	non-summary	Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?	Yes olaparib was shown to be effective for treatment of prostate cancer. Olaparib led to stable disease or tumor regressions of prostate cancer patients.	We hypothesized that metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi olaparib demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index &lt; 0.9) whereas normal prostatic cells did not.Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone.	The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%.In addition phase III trials in breast gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies including prostate cancer non-small cell lung cancer Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone.Olaparib one of the most studied PARPis has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification.Collectively cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage resulting in prostate cancer cell death. In addition phase III trials in breast gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies including prostate cancer non-small cell lung cancer Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.	0.09523809523809523	0.047619047619047616	Hard
